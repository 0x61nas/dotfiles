This is gruvbox theme for the [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator.
It is based on [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme for vim by morhetz <morhetz@gmail.com>.

## Installation

Put the line
```
include <path_to_theme_file>
```
at the end of your kitty config file (most likely `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`). If you don't have a config file, create file `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` with that single line.
